# 15-418 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming Final Project
15-418 Spring 2020 Project: Applications of Direction-Optimized Parallel Breadth-First Search

By: Andrew Gu and Patrick Liu

## Summary
In this project, we implement **parallel breadth-first search** (BFS) using top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid (direction-optimizing) strategies and explore their usage in three randomized graph algorithm tasks:  

**(1)** low diameter graph decomposition   
**(2)** strongly-connected components detection  
**(3)** least-element lists construction  

We hope to examine the efficacy of the BFS strategies for these algorithms, measuring speedup and profiling the runtimes for implementations in C++ with OpenMP.
