# 15-418 Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming Final Project
15418 Spring 2020 Project: Exploring Applications of Parallel Breadth-First Search in Randomized Graph Algorithms  
By: Andrew Gu and Patrick Liu

## Summary
In this project, we implement **parallel breadth-first search** (BFS) using top-down and bottom-up strategies and explore their usage in three randomized graph algorithms:  

**(1)** ball growing with exponential delay for low diameter graph decomposition   
**(2)** random incremental strongly-connected components detection  
**(3)** random incremental least-element lists construction  

We hope to examine the efficacy of the two BFS strategies for these algorithms, measuring speedup and profiling the runtimes for implementations in C++ with OpenMP.
